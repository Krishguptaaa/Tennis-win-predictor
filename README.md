## 🧠 How it Works

This app predicts the winner between two professional tennis players by considering key features like:

- Player height
- Handedness (left/right)
- Current rank and ranking points
- Surface type (grass, clay, hard)
- Tournament level (e.g., Grand Slam, ATP 1000)
- Round of the match
- Best-of (3 or 5 sets)

The model is trained using historical ATP data and leverages CatBoost for accurate classification on structured features.
